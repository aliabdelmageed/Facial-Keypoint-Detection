# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
This is my first project for "Computer Vision Nanodegree" at Udacity.
This prohect is a part of Computer Vision Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
In this project, I tried to build Facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in Three Python notebooks.

__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and the trained CNN
